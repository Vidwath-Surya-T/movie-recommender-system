# Movie Recommender System
A content based movie recommender system using cosine similarity
This project implements a Movie Recommender System that helps users discover new films by offering personalized recommendations based on their selected favorite movie. By analyzing movie metadata such as genres, keywords, cast, and crew, the system computes similarity scores between movies, allowing it to return the top five recommendations most related to the user's choice. The interactive Streamlit interface provides a seamless experience, enabling users to easily select a movie and instantly receive suggestions, making movie exploration both engaging and efficient.
